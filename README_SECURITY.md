# ðŸ”’ Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the XLab Web application.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **NextAuth.js** with Google OAuth for secure authentication
- Session-based authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control for admin features
- Secure session storage and cookie handling

### 2. Data Protection

- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for sensitive user data
- Secure key derivation with salt
- Integrity verification for stored data
- Automatic data backups

### 3. Web Security

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** headers to prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection using secure tokens
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- XSS protection headers
- Clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options)
- MIME type sniffing protection

### 4. API Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure error handling (no sensitive information in errors)
- Authentication required for sensitive operations

### 5. Infrastructure Security

- Environment variable management with .env.local
- Secure defaults for development and production
- Regular security audits with automated tools

## Security Testing

Run the security check script to scan for vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm run security-check
```

This script checks for:
- Hardcoded secrets
- Insecure crypto implementations
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure configurations
- Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Always validate and sanitize user input**
3. Use the provided security utilities for encryption/decryption
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Log security-relevant events

### For Administrators

1. **Rotate secrets regularly**
2. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Run security checks before deployments
5. Enable HTTPS in production

## Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@xlab.example.com
- Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed

## Security Updates

- **v1.0.1**: Added Content-Security-Policy headers
- **v1.0.2**: Implemented rate limiting
- **v1.0.3**: Enhanced encryption for user data
- **v1.0.4**: Added automatic security scanning
